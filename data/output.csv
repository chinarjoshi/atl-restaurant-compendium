2. Masterpiece,"The first bite: Masterpiece’s dry-fried eggplant (Eggplant with Chilli Powder and Pepper Ash Powder), which sits at the pinnacle of every iteration we’ve encountered of the beloved Sichuan dish. The second bite: Masterpiece’s Dong Po Pork, a braised brick of pork belly lacquered in a mahogany-hued glaze that tastes as if it were a syrup extracted from a mythical tree. The exterior is crackly-crisp and salty, the interior creamy and sweet, the level of ma la (numbing spice) precisely calibrated with a liberal but not obnoxious dose of fragrant, crunchy Sichuan peppercorns.",2,Duluth,3940 Buford Highway,masterpiece-chinese.com,00:02:00,00:31:00,True
3. Spring,"You’ll also find our favorite fish dish in town: pan-roasted halibut with squash, wax beans, asparagus, and beurre blanc. It was situated practically on top of the railroad tracks in a remote corner of Marietta Square, a destination not exactly known for culinary risk-taking. Pappardelle with green garlic cream, morels, fava beans, and Parmesan is a joyous celebration of the restaurant’s namesake.",3,Marietta,36 Mill Street,springmarietta.com,01:43:00,00:26:00,False
4. Sushi Hayakawa,"Not only is that your entry fee to the restaurant’s 14-course, two-and-a-half-hour honkaku (authentic) omakase (a Japanese feast in which the diner lets the chef steer); it also gets you front-and-center seats at Atsushi “Art” Hayakawa’s sushi counter. The former will get you premium nigiri (the fish is flown in from Japanese markets) that Hayakawa gently brushes with his housemade soy sauce—and, if you’re lucky, his signature dish of monkfish liver and scallops. Hayakawa is the most delightful character in Atlanta’s food scene, a master of his craft who’s as skilled at handling fish and rice as he is at charming his guests.",4,Doraville,5979 Buford Highway,sushihayakawa.com,01:24:00,00:20:00,False
5. Bacchanalia,"Even before the brigade of Atlanta’s high-end restaurants (and high-end everything) began its trek toward less-exclusive zip codes, Bacchanalia entered its second chapter, boldly moving in 1999 to a repurposed warehouse in a then sleepy part of town: the Westside. And though Bacchanalia’s elegantly simple food—crafted with impeccably sourced ingredients (many of them from Quatrano’s own farm)—hasn’t changed much in 26 years, it’s no less influential. Chef Anne Quatrano and her husband, Cliff Harrison, haven’t merely stayed ahead of the curve—they’ve drawn the curve.",4,Westside,1460 Ellsworth Industrial Boulevard,starprovisions.com/bacchanalia,00:20:00,00:13:00,False
6. Boccalupo,"Instead of confining himself to narrow traditions, he creates cult favorites: black spaghetti with red shrimp, hot Calabrian sausage, and scallions; 20-yolk tagliatelle with mushrooms and kale kimchi; and pan-fried white lasagna with creme fraiche and jalapeño pesto. BoccaLupo’s appetizers are creative and smart (think octopus and mortadella spiedino or wild calamari in brodetto), its scene intimate yet lively (tucked away in a calm corner of an otherwise oversaturated Inman Park), and its beverage program as accomplished as everything Logue sets his mind to. Head for the covered patio or the minuscule bar, both among the best spots in the city for conversation.",2,Inman Park,753 Edgewood Avenue,boccalupoatl.com,00:23:00,00:11:00,False
7. Kimball House,"The vegetable sides—such as a $10 stir fry of mushroom, turnip, broccoli, radish, and greens, glammed up with ají amarillo butter—get as much respect from the kitchen as the $110 steak dinner. Yes, the oyster program is the best around, down to co-owner and bivalve evangelist Bryan Rackley’s impressively specific tasting notes (“green beans & cantaloupe . . . From grouper collar to bar steak, lemon-pepper chicken skins to caviar and Carolina Gold rice middlins, there’s nothing Kimball House can’t do.",3,Decatur,303 East Howard Avenue,kimball-house.com,00:46:00,00:22:00,False
8. LanZhou Ramen,"The resulting noodles—or, if you prefer, the thicker, knife-cut ones—show up in bowls of fragrant beef broth brimming with wilted greens and tender meat, or stir-fried with your choice of three spice options: regular, spicy, or laced with cumin seeds. The city of Lanzhou is the noodle capital of China, and Buford Highway strip-mall joint LanZhou Ramen is the noodle capital of metro Atlanta. You can (and should) observe their creation by gazing into LanZhou’s kitchen through a picture window that dramatically frames the hypnotic act of rolling, stretching, and spinning the cascading tendrils of springy dough.",1,Doraville,5231 Buford Highway,lanzhouramenatlanta.com,01:17:00,00:19:00,False
9. Staplehouse,"Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, Staplehouse has gracefully met the moment, closing its dining room and reconfiguring into a market offering charcuterie, pastries, and house-made pantry items to go, plus a judicious selection of prepared dishes (beef cheek hand pie, alkaline noodles with turnips and chili crisp, chicken liver tart) that can either be taken away or consumed on-site, drink in hand, on a beautiful outdoor patio space.",2,Old Fourth Ward,541 Edgewood Avenue,staplehouse.com,00:21:00,00:09:00,False
10. Talat Market,"In practice, that means dishes like yum phonlamai, a salad built around whatever fruit is in season (peach, melon, blueberries) dressed with a savory, funky mix of lemongrass, mint, cilantro, scallop floss, and fish sauce; yum khao tod, a crispy rice salad with housemade red chili jam; the meat salad laab, featuring ingredients as disparate as duck heart and sunchokes; crispy mussel pancakes; and much, much more. Decorated with a lavish mural, lush green walls, and ceiling-hung flower pots, Talat Market stays on its toes and keeps diners on theirs with a daily-changing menu based on a winning concept: Thai technique, Georgia ingredients. When Parnass Savang and Rod Lassiter finally opened this brick-and-mortar space in the inauspicious month of April 2020, they were doing curbside service only, finding themselves selling out every night.",2,Summerhill,112 Ormond Street,talatmarketatl.com,00:28:00,00:12:00,False
Wonderkid,"Like the restaurant’s designers, opening chef Justin Dixon—who has recently moved on to other pastures—was refreshingly unfaithful to the diner concept: His often brilliant interpretations cover not just the classics (English breakfast, meatloaf melt with pimento cheese and bacon jam) but also wonderful mushroom empanadas and chicken wings prepared “Buford Highway style,” with chili oil, peanuts, and lime. It might look something like this spot in the Atlanta Dairies complex, which eschews retro kitsch in favor of a riotous aesthetic mashup: This is a diner with groovy wallpaper, ’70s lighting, and pictures of Prince on the wall, plus a bartender behind a curved counter slinging potent cocktails. It sprang from a partnership between Big Citizen (the group behind Bon Ton and the Lawrence) and King of Pops, whose soft-serve is available here on its own or blended into boozy drinks.",2,Reynoldstown,777 Memorial Drive,wonderkidatl.com,00:26:00,00:11:00,False
Little Bear,"The engagingly written menu changes with the seasons, with temporary treasures (one night recently: Georgia shrimp with fig sweet-and-sour sauce and shishito peppers; eggplant with peaches, whey sauce, chili paste, and “herbs out the ass”) joining a few repeat faves, like chicken thighs with dan dan yogurt and Manischewitz vinegar and a striking black and white torte. But Stieber, pivoting to a takeout-only model, endured through the pandemic, finally welcoming diners this past May to sit down in Little Bear’s bright, modern dining room and enjoy his weird, iconoclastic, Jewish-ish/Sichuan-ish cooking. After making his name with the pop-up series Eat Me Speak Me, Stieber finally made the move to brick-and-mortar with Little Bear, which opened in Summerhill in February 2020.",2,Summerhill,71 Georgia Avenue,littlebearatl.com,00:27:00,00:10:00,False
Nur Kitchen,"He’s a magician with classics like hummus and baba ghanoush, and his eclectic background—Lavi was born in Israel, of Turkish and Libyan descent—informs the wide Eastern Mediterranean scope of this restaurant, whose pantry of inspirations stretches “from Turkey to Jaffa Port.” Driving out on Buford Highway toward Norcross, you’ll hear the siren songs of about a thousand incredible restaurants before you even make it to Nur Kitchen’s parking lot—but if it’s some of the metro’s best mezze you’re after, it’s best to put your hands over your ears, keep your eyes on the road, and arrive here hungry. A spectacular talent whose range continues to reveal itself, Lavi gained fans through his catering business Let’s Eat and in the kitchen of the delicious but short-lived downtown restaurant Rozina Bakehouse.",2,Buford Highway,7130 Buford Highway,nurkitchenusa.com,01:27:00,00:21:00,False
Tum Pok Pok,"Weerasin’s larb—pork or chicken, seasoned with lime juice and tiny chilis, ginger, peanuts, and scallions, and served with sticky rice and cabbage leaves—offers a world of bracing flavor. Buford Highway has long lacked much of a Thai scene—so when Tum Pok Pok opened up in the same blessed BuHi shopping plaza as Food Terminal and Saigon Tofu, it was a welcome addition to our city’s most international corridor. Weerasin herself is from the south of Thailand and has been rolling out nightly specials that reflect that region, like a crab omelet and kua kling: a perilously hot but tasty dish of ground pork with red curry paste and shaved makrut lime leaves.",1,Chamblee,5000 Buford Highway,tumpokpok.com,01:12:00,00:20:00,False
Lucian Books and Wine,"Or maybe it just felt like a sigh of relief: What sweeter pleasure than to share a plate and a bottle with an old friend—or a new fancy—in this chic but inviting dining room on a busy Buckhead corner? Dishes change seasonally, but expect fare like buttery raw hamachi and thinly sliced black radish, doused tableside with a vinegar-spiked buttermilk dressing, and ricotta gnudi with truffle and maitake mushroom and a luscious beurre monté. The cellar may be spacious, but the larder ain’t: Chef Brian Hendrickson’s tightly focused, finely executed menu features a handful of small plates, a few entrees, and a bowl of french fries worth ordering for the lemony sorrel mayo alone.",3,Buckhead,3005 Peachtree Road,lucianbooksandwine.com,00:32:00,00:16:00,False
Supremo Taco,"It eventually landed a spot on Memorial Drive, though the counter-service, takeout-only model means it retains some streetside vibes—and helped it weather the pandemic, when Supremo was more impervious than most to lockdowns and mandates, and when its legions of fans found great comfort enfolded in its astonishing handmade tortillas. Supremo sold out often during the pandemic and still does: particularly, crowd-pleasers like lamb barbacoa with chili de arbol, chicken mole poblano, black bean with squash and tomato, aguachile tostadas, fried quesadillas . . . Supremo built its rep as a taco truck doing late-night test runs at 8Arm, which is co-owned by Supremo partner Nhan Le.",1,Grant Park,701 Memorial Drive,supremotaco.com,00:25:00,00:11:00,False
Buena Gente Cuban Bakery,"They overlook no detail in the construction of the iconic Cuban sandwich: The bolo ham is delicious, the mustard is sharp, the mojo-roasted pork carries an enchanting hint of the citrus it was marinated in, and the melty Swiss cheese and pressed, crunchy bread elevate this creation to near-pizza levels of perfection. Cubanos and other sandwiches (medianoche, pan con bistec) aren’t the only items Buena Gente has aced: The glass dessert case is packed with perfectly rendered pastries from chicken empanadas to guava-filled pastelitos, arroz con leche to tres leches cake. The good people behind this cute-as-a-button operation, Manny Rodriguez and Stacie Antich, first opened their food truck in 2016, making the leap in 2020 to a narrow storefront in a busy Decatur strip mall.",1,Decatur,1365 Clairmont Road,buenagenteatl.com,00:45:00,00:21:00,False
Chef Winnie’s Kitchen,"When it comes to the tried and true, her renditions are exquisite: Emory’s combo kitfo (ground beef seasoned with the brightly colored chili blend mitmita and sauteed in purified butter) and fitfit (torn injera soaked in spicy sauce) is one of the best dishes we ate all year, and her many vegan or vegetarian entrees easily compete in the big leagues. And that’s just the half of it: Chef Winnie is equally adept with curries, fish tacos, Philly cheesesteaks, and bespoke creations like an Ethiopian-spiced quesadilla stuffed with chicken and veggies. Humble even by Clarkston standards, this minuscule spot from Woinshet Legesse Emory—aka Chef Winnie—is an international wonder with an Ethiopian heart.",1,Clarkston,4238 East Ponce de Leon Avenue,chefwinnieskitchen.com,01:15:00,00:25:00,False
Lake and Oak Neighborhood BBQ,"Fans flock here (SORRY) for the chicken, brined for a day to enhance its tenderness and slathered in a collard pesto; for the coffee- and pepper-rubbed brisket; for the rib slabs and the cider-vinegar pulled pork; and for creative sides like collard green fried rice. Opening in July 2020, Richards and partner Joshua Lee took the pandemic in stride, inviting diners to hit up the takeout window and keep their social distance on a convivial streetside patio. That happy al fresco scene (and the smells wafting from the Big Green Egg smoker out front) beckons passersby into an instant top-tier player in a city that doesn’t lack for barbecue joints.",1,East Lake,2358 Hosea L.

Floataway Cafe,"Star chef-restaurateur Anne Quatrano’s airy little Mediterranean oasis, which for more than two decades has resided in an industrial complex near Emory, is so chic it could’ve opened yesterday. Under executive chef Travis Hawthorne, some dishes conjure Greece: fire-kissed tentacles of octopus curled around chickpeas and briny Castelvetrano olives. Mention Floataway Cafe to any in-the-know Atlantan and you’ll be met with lustful moans.",2,North Druid Hills,1123 Zonolite Road,starprovisions.com/floataway-cafe,00:34:00,00:18:00,False
Canoe,"And a special of roasted monkfish with broccoli rabe and fingerlings in a caper vinaigrette is the type of thing we’d like to eat every day—for the next 30 years. If you haven’t been to the nearly 30-year-old restaurant in a while, you won’t have forgotten that view—but you might not recall how equally ravishing the food is. The earthiness from hearty hunks of Purple Haze carrots is heightened with crunchy hazelnuts and a smear of Moroccan-spiced coconut.",3,Vinings,4199 Paces Ferry Road,canoeatl.com,00:56:00,00:15:00,False
Sotto Sotto,"Classic pasta options—such as tortelli di Michelangelo Buonarroti, a 16th century recipe of veal, chicken, and pork ravioli in a butter-sage sauce—are the kind of thing you want to eat forever. In this age of ever-adapting seasonal menus, Sotto Sotto’s mostly unchanged lineup still holds our rapt attention. There’s a reason Riccardo Ullio’s Inman Park stalwart has been around for more than two decades: It’s our most consistent and satisfying Italian spot.",2,Inman Park,313 North Highland Avenue,sottosottoatl.com,00:20:00,00:11:00,False
Kyma,"You can make a feast out of chef Pano Karatassos’s nearly two-dozen shareable meze plates—in particular, wood-grilled octopus with olives and capers, white beans stewed with tomatoes, and lamb pie. The ocean-blue and gleaming-white temple known as Kyma, which means “wave” in Greek, is Buckhead Life Restaurant Group’s brightest star. If you want to splurge, choose one of the $40-per-pound whole fish that are so beautifully arranged in the restaurant’s display case they appear to be swimming through a sea of crushed ice.",3,Buckhead,3085 Piedmont Road,buckheadrestaurants.com/restaurant/kyma,00:38:00,00:15:00,False
La Grotta Ristorante Italiano,"La Grotta opened in 1978, and it’s a welcome throwback to another time—when white tablecloths still graced tables and truffles were shaved onto your plate tableside. In the basement of an unassuming south Buckhead apartment building sits one of Atlanta’s oldest restaurants. The regal servers deliver bygone glamour, along with a wide range of pasta and veal options.",3,Buckhead,2637 Peachtree Road,lagrottaatlanta.com,00:28:00,00:15:00,False
Tiny Lou's,"In the basement you’ve got the storied strip club the Clermont Lounge; on the roof you’ve got gorgeous skyline views; and in between is Tiny Lou’s, an intimate, dimly lit restaurant whose 2018 opening heralded the return of revolutionary French cooking to the Atlanta culinary scene. The kitchen staff responsible for Tiny Lou’s 1.0 have since moved on, replaced in spring 2021 by executive chef Jon Novak (formerly sous chef of the Napa Valley restaurant Torc) and pastry chef Charmain Ware. Novak’s menu offers bistro favorites—steak frites, French onion soup, swordfish au poivre—and specialties that change with the seasons; Ware’s pastries, like those of predecessor Claudia Martinez, are works of art.",3,Poncey-Highland,789 Ponce de Leon Avenue,tinylous.com,00:15:00,00:09:00,True
Octopus Bar,"The 2011 brainchild of Nhan Le and the late Angus Brown, Octopus Bar is still the coolest restaurant in Atlanta, and chef Alexander Young’s dishes are as punk as they are pretty: dry-fried eggplant, served skin-on, is seasoned with black garlic oil, and icicle radishes delicately intermingle with tendrils of radish pods atop a sheet of creamy chevre. Even before Octopus Bar opens at 10:30 p.m., the night owls will have swooped in to claim their perch. There is no better meal to be had in the middle of the night—and few that are better at any time of day.",2,East Atlanta Village,560 Gresham Avenue,octopusbaratl.com,00:35:00,00:12:00,False
Ticonderoga Club,"In this endearingly dark little room in the corner of Krog Street Market, Greg Best and Paul Calvert—two of the city’s most ingenious bartenders—mix and stir and shake and dazzle; their concise cocktail list is reason enough to endure the weekend wait. But even those drinks can’t upstage executive chef David Bies’s nostalgia-inducing menu—including the city’s best clam roll, best steak tartare, and best Cobb salad.",3,Inman Park,99 Krog Street,ticonderogaclub.com,00:21:00,00:10:00,False
Bon Ton,"Bon Ton is no doubt as cool as its predecessor, and the Viet-Cajun menu is clever without being too much so: You’ll find ground beef wrapped in betel leaves, seafood boils, oyster and cilantro dirty fried rice, and one of our favorite sandwiches: a Nashville hot oyster roll that’s extra punched up with XO sauce. Co-owner Eric Simpkins, a longtime denizen of Ponce, teamed up with Hieu Pham of Buford Highway’s Crawfish Shack and Darren Carr of the former Top Flr to create the perfect concept to fill Top Flr’s void. This relative newcomer to the Ponce corridor feels like its been part of the street’s eccentric culture forever, and that’s a high compliment.",2,Midtown,674 Myrtle Street,bontonatl.com,00:10:00,00:05:00,True
8Arm,"The menu can be a challenge to navigate, but 8Arm’s raw-fish offerings and nightly specials range from pristine (various cuts of bluefish tuna reveal the depths of flavor the fish has to offer) to sublime (raw sea bream with watermelon radish kimchi). The kitchen offers pitch-perfect renditions of Japanese street foods—dumplings, edamame, the battered octopus balls takoyaki—as well as rotating dishes like buttery, nut-brown miso cod and the savory custard chawanmushi. This hip Ponce restaurant has lived many lives, forced to reinvent itself in 2017 after the sudden death of original chef-partner Angus Brown, and then again in 2021 with the departure of the redoubtable Maricela Vega.",2,Virginia-Highland,710 Ponce de Leon Avenue,8armatl.com,00:13:00,00:08:00,True
Poor Hendrix,"Russell composes marvelous salads (think local lettuces, Manchego, peanuts, and pickled green beans) and elevates peanut butter mousse with olive oil, salt, and peanut meringue—but he isn’t above serving wings and Rice Krispies treats. Once you’re inside, you’ll find a long, narrow bar that feels like a clubhouse for young, stylish neighbors hip to chef Aaron Russell, whose career includes influential stints at fine-dining bastions Seeger’s (RIP) and Restaurant Eugene. Blink and you might miss this small storefront on a mostly residential stretch in East Lake.",2,East Lake,2371 Hosea L. Williams Drive,poorhendrix.com,00:45:00,00:15:00,False
Gunshow,"The dining room is short on luxury—stark spotlights, metal tables, loud rock music—but high on intrigue. You might find Hawaiian paté en croute with pineapple, jalapeño, and Parmesan aioli, or confit sunchoke with peanuts, garlic, coffee, and seaweed. Seven to eight chefs cook and then deliver plates directly to diners, who can choose to accept or reject them.",3,Omewood Park,924 Garrett Street,gunshowatl.com,00:30:00,00:10:00,False
Twisted Soul Cookhouse & Pours,"She also artfully builds on culinary traditions of black Southerners—think hoisin oxtails with shallot-ginger roasted bok choy and cornflake-crusted black grouper. She’s quick to share her unfiltered opinion on the state of soul food, black restaurateurship, and any other social issue you care to discuss.

Argosy,"It pulls off this juggling act in a large, easygoing nerd paradise where custom-built wooden sea creatures hang from the ceiling and analog parlor games are played in the back. The menu at this East Atlanta Village gastropub offers everything from Shaolin Wings (with Tokyo mayo and purple daikon) to charred octopus (with fingerlings, fennel, and fried capers). The pizza might not be the most name-dropped in town, but the wood-fired crust and Spotted Trotter–sourced toppings make it one of Atlanta’s best.",2,East Atlanta Village,470 Flat Shoals Avenue,argosy-east.com,00:37:00,00:11:00,False
Le Fat,"Inside Guy Wong’s modern Vietnamese joint, the clamorous space is as chic as the rest of its Westside brethren, from the hand-painted chinoiserie wallpaper and curved wood bar to the herringbone floors and gallery wall of vintage prints. Feast on bao stuffed with soft-shell crab, bacon, and sambal mayo, chicken clay pot with crispy rice, and salty-crunchy lemongrass shrimp. And if you don’t order the pho with brisket, flank steak, and beef ball, at least go for the side of pho broth.",2,Westside,935 Marietta Street,lefatatl.com,00:10:00,00:07:00,True
The Optimist,"At Ford Fry’s stylishly nautical seafood restaurant, there are many ways to plot a course to an ideal meal, but here’s our favorite: a dozen impeccable oysters; one of four crudos (think salmon with chorizo, strawberry, and fava bean); a hulking tentacle of octopus; and the best lobster roll in the city. If you’re forced to wait for a table, idle away the time on the minigolf lawn outside.",3,Westside,914 Howell Mill Road,theoptimistrestaurant.com,00:10:00,00:07:00,True
Banshee,"You’ll be further captivated by the moody vibe of the small dining room, swathed in peacock-blue wallpaper and subway tile and velvet drapes, and by cocktails such as the Stately Hag: a tart and herbaceous mix of reposado tequila, Cocchi Americano, Strega, lemon, and thyme. Who before Wynn has served warm Native American fry bread with pepperoni butter and scallions as a form of exalted bread service? The neighborhood’s most sophisticated restaurant is a tiny, highly original operation that transcends genre and remains in tune with its offbeat surroundings.",2,East Atlanta Village,1271 Glenwood Avenue,banshee-atl.com,00:35:00,00:11:00,False
Busy Bee,"Atlanta would be a lesser town without Busy Bee, which provided sustenance to Civil Rights leaders, including Martin Luther King Jr. Since 1947, the woman-owned institution has reliably served heaping helpings of soul food: smothered pork chops, oxtails, fried chicken, collards, and cornbread dressing. Old-school politicos and R&B stars alike continue to file into the tight quarters on the outskirts of Atlanta’s HBCU complex, seeking lunch or early dinner (it closes at 7 p.m.).

Tassili’s Raw Reality,"There are 40 ounces of kale packed into the Mandingo wrap at Tassili’s Raw Reality, which has occupied the colorful ground floor of a two-story duplex in West End since 2011. Lest you scoff at its $25 price tag, take note that this wrap could easily feed you for three days—and that it’s so magical you’ll actually want to spend three days eating it. Just patiently wait your turn in the slow-moving line to the counter, and fixate on the beatific diners scarfing down various wraps ($9 to $14 for the normal-sized ones).",1,West End,1059 Ralph D.

Empire State South,"It’s been over a decade since celebrity chef Hugh Acheson opened Empire State South and challenged Atlanta’s notion that Southern food is something preciously preserved in the past. A lot has changed since then, but Empire State South remains a destination restaurant in a part of Midtown that has too few of them.

The General Muir,"In seven years, the General Muir has become indispensable for its upscale Jewish deli–inspired menu: If you have a hankering for piled-high pastrami on rye or chopped liver with pletzel bread, there is no better place.

Chicken + Beer,"Ludacris and his partner, restaurant group Jackmont Hospitality, don’t peddle “airport wings” (the flavorless variety created solely to sustain a captive, security-cleared audience); these whole wings rival those you’ll find at any restaurant in Atlanta, the world’s wing capital. There is no better restaurant co-owned by a rapper and named for a seminal album—especially if, like the intro track from Ludacris’s Chicken-n-Beer, you prefer your comfort food “Southern Fried.” If or when Luda and company decide to expand the franchise beyond Hartsfield-Jackson, and members of the general public have an easier time getting hold of the short-rib mac and cheese, it will be even clearer that this food holds its own against restaurants far beyond Concourse D.",2,Hartsfield-Jackson,"Concourse D, Gate 5",chickenandbeer.com,01:07:00,00:15:00,False
La Tavola,"Whether you’re in the mood for straightforward spaghetti and veal meatballs, deeply murky and oceanic zuppa di pesce, or just the housemade buttermilk ricotta and a glass of Sicilian red at the bar, you’ll be right at home.

Nevertheless, what you eat is likely sourced from a local or regional farm, which gives Pascarella the opportunity to draft new and imaginative culinary tales—or should we say A Moveable Feast?

El Tesoro,"“El Tesoro” means “the treasure,” and the restaurant’s owners have found one in Cristina Lugo Soto, a home cook who hails from the Mexican coastal state of Guerrero and runs the kitchen with her daughter, Mayra. The tacos come as tacos are supposed to, with supremely flavorful meat that requires no embellishment aside from micro-diced onion, a light shower of chopped cilantro, a squeeze of lime, and, if you must, a streak of one of three homemade salsas. Soto offers three tamale flavors—pork with green salsa, chicken with chipotle salsa, and rajas with mushroom and squash—and if there’s a more craveable masa in existence, we’ve yet to find it.",1,Edgewood,1374 Arkwright Place,eltesoroatl.com,00:31:00,00:11:00,False
Snackboxe Bistro,"Inspired by the bright flavors they encountered on a trip to their native Laos, husband and wife Vanh Sengaphone and Thip Athakhanh craft street food–inspired dishes vibrant with heat and acid, including a peerless laap (a spicy and tart meat salad more commonly known by its Thai name, larb) and a sinus-clearing bowl of khao poon (its curry broth, rich with coconut milk, clings to long rice noodles). But with the early 2018 opening of insta-hit Snackboxe in Doraville, there’s now an excellent representation of the underappreciated cuisine right in our backyard. Laotian food has long been overshadowed in Atlanta by the cuisine of neighboring Thailand.",1,Doraville,6035 Peachtree Road,snackboxebistro.com,01:16:00,00:21:00,False
Heirloom Market BBQ,"Heirloom is a love story—between its co-owners, wife and husband Jiyeon Lee and Cody Taylor, and between the homestyle Korean cooking of her childhood and the homestyle Texan cooking of his. As with all great love stories, the passion between miso paste and collard greens or kimchi and coleslaw was almost accidental at first, but these pairings were clearly meant to be. Our only gripe is that the mostly takeout operation offers just a few standing tables; this food is too good to rush through while on your feet and too tempting to drive all the way home with.",1,Cumberland,2243 Akers Mill Road,heirloommarketbbq.com,01:19:00,00:16:00,False
Chai Pani,"Gone are the beloved okra fries—but in their place are fantastically flavored dishes like tomato cheese uttapam (a fermented rice and lentil pancake, served with two kinds of chutney), Indo-Chinese–style chili chicken, and a Bengali-style fried catfish filet. Meherwan Irani’s Decatur destination—part of a mini empire stretching between Atlanta and Asheville—has pivoted several times in recent years, switching to takeout-only during the pandemic and then reopening, in summer 2021, with a refreshed menu that emphasizes Indian home-cooking favorites and regional specialties. The colorful dining room remains a cheerful hang, and the cocktails are still tops.",1,Decatur,406 West Ponce de Leon Avenue,chaipanidecatur.com,00:46:00,00:20:00,False
Community Q BBQ,"Opened in 2009 with several partners in a tight little shopping center near Emory, Community Q offers moist and tender pulled pork that isn’t obnoxiously smoky, reliably robust St. Louis ribs, and ridiculously rich and creamy three-cheese mac and cheese. You may want to mix the vinegar-based sauce into the tomato and molasses one—but, as is true of the best barbecue joints, these meats are tasty enough to eschew the sauces entirely. Back then, hoity-toity chefs hadn’t begun to launch the kind of barbecue operations that source their meats extra carefully and support organic farms.",1,North Decatur,1361 Clairmont Road,communityqbbq.com,00:45:00,00:21:00,False
Taqueria del Sol,"Two decades and six locations later, customers still line up for Hernandez’s Southern-Mexican mashup cuisine: fried-chicken tacos with lime-jalapeño mayonnaise, refried-bean enchiladas with a side of turnip greens, and shrimp corn chowder. Eddie Hernandez and Mike Klank opened the first Taqueria del Sol on the Westside in 2000, cranking out crowd-pleasing $2 tacos. Pick up his cookbook, Turnip Greens & Tortillas, which was one of our favorites of 2018.",1,Cheshire Bridge,2165 Cheshire Bridge Road,taqueriadelsol.com,00:37:00,00:13:00,False
Rising Son,"They came to the adorable Avondale Estates storefront for fried trout with cheese grits and for vegetables—collards, kale, sweet potatoes—that Hudson grows himself. When Hudson Rouse, formerly of Home Grown, and his wife, Kathryn Fitzgerald Rouse, opened this creative meat-and-three for breakfast and lunch in 2016, the crowds flocked. As the woman sitting next to us on a recent visit told her server: “I’m upset—I’ve lived here for 18 months and only just discovered this place!”",1,Avondale Estates,124 North Avondale Road,risingsonavondale.com,00:54:00,00:26:00,False
Fox Bros. Bar-B-Q,"The brothers’ brisket is legendary, but just as epic are their over-the-top barbecue offerings: the camp classic Frito Pie served in the actual bag, hickory-smoked jumbo wings dressed in homemade sauce, and a nine-inch, smoked beef rib that looks like something a caveman might devour. The Foxes have built upon their success with a line of barbecue and wing sauce sold at Whole Foods and other stores, a partnership with the Atlanta Falcons, and a “Que-osk” location near SweetWater Brewing. In 2007, twin brothers Jonathan and Justin Fox opened their DeKalb Avenue restaurant.",1,Candler Park,1238 DeKalb Avenue,foxbrosbbq.com,00:28:00,00:13:00,False
Arepa Mia,"Even more rewarding is a visit to her cheerful, stand-alone spot in Avondale Estates, where she also serves specialties such as pabellón (shredded grassfed beef with black beans, fried plantains, and queso de año) and avocado and heart-of-palm salad dressed with sweet corn juice. Growing up, Lis Hernandez spent countless days with her mother in the kitchen making arepas—stuffed cornmeal patties, crunchy from a hot grill—that they sold on the streets in their native Venezuela. Hernandez’s arepas first appeared in Atlanta at the Sweet Auburn Curb Market in 2012, and she still sells them there.",1,Avondale Estates,10 North Clarendon Avenue,arepamiaatlanta.com,00:55:00,00:27:00,False
Taqueria Don Sige,"But ignore any misinformed impulses because you’re here for traditional tacos (chopped onion, cilantro, lime, and radish), irresistibly priced at $1.50 each (pollo is great, but chorizo, camarones, and lengua are phenomenal). Located behind a gas station, in a tiny strip mall on the border of College Park and East Point, Don Sige isn’t known for its decor. The spicy salsa verde isn’t complex and doesn’t need to be, and the expertly wrapped burrito and liberally sauced steak fajita are as flavorful as they are unfancy.",1,College Park,1720 Vesta Avenue,None,00:51:00,00:18:00,False
Desta Ethiopian Kitchen,"Despite the competition, it’s still the best place in town to scoop up kitfo (raw, minced beef seasoned with chili powder and spiced butter) and miser (red lentils stewed with cayenne, onion, garlic, and ginger) using soft, spongy, fermented injera bread. The menu, which allows you to make decisions based on how daring you are, demystifies Ethiopian cuisine, and the tree that rises up from the middle of the covered patio and through its roof makes you forget you’re in the middle of an asphalt sea. Desta is one of three Ethiopian restaurants at the corner of Briarcliff and Clairmont roads—including the stylish and formidable newcomer Feedel Bistro.",1,North Druid Hills,3086 Briarcliff Road,destaethiopiankitchen.com,00:54:00,00:14:00,False
Aria,"Plates are adorned with drops and loops and smears of sauces, and even if that’s not typically your thing, you’ll still be wowed by Aria’s artistry—particularly when the plate holds caramelized scallops with perfect piles of sunchoke, Brussels, and rutabaga. Perhaps you’ve had your fill of beet salads, but you haven’t had a beet salad until you’ve had this one; with gold and ruby-red wedges mingling with candied walnuts atop thick, lemony yogurt, the dish is exceptional in its simplicity. Whether the date night in question is prom, an anniversary, an engagement, or some less monumental event, Aria is up to the occasion.",4,Buckhead,490 East Paces Ferry Road,aria-atl.com,00:37:00,00:14:00,False
Tomo,"Your best option is to snag one of five nightly spots for Naito’s omakase (tasting menu), which starts at $100 and could include fluke with ponzu gelee and a lamb chop dusted in citrusy, almost minty sansho powder. If you want to fully experience Tomo, skip the sprawling menu; the shrimp tempura roll and teriyaki-glazed chicken breast will only distract you from the immensity of chef Tomohiro Naito’s gift for Japanese cuisine. Your faux-makase could include slivers of superfresh sashimi shimmering in a shallow pool of yuzu ponzu and extra-virgin olive oil and a simple slice of miso-marinated, broiled black cod.",4,Buckhead,3630 Peachtree Road,tomorestaurant.com,00:44:00,00:14:00,False
Bones,"Even lunch at the bar is a treat, a prime perch for sipping a martini, chowing down on one of the city’s best burgers, and indulging in a mile-high ice cream pie. Start with lump-crab cocktail or lobster bisque or a wedge salad, and pair your steak or chop with a loaded baked potato and grilled asparagus. If corporate bigwigs want to blow $6,000 on wine, they do it at this landmark, wood- paneled steakhouse.",4,Buckhead,3130 Piedmont Road,bonesrestaurant.com,00:38:00,00:14:00,False
Lazy Betty,"Hsu’s Steak & Eggs is a nod to his family’s frequent visits to Waffle House, but in his version, a dry-aged New York strip is accompanied by a sous-vide egg wrapped in a wasabi leaf. In the magnificently transformed Candler Park space that formerly housed Radial Cafe, choose from two tasting menus—six courses for $130 or eight for $170 (gratuity included). And though he’s opened the most ambitious new restaurant Atlanta has seen in several years, that doesn’t mean his rarefied food is short on fun.",4,Candler Park,1530 DeKalb Avenue,lazybettyatl.com,00:30:00,00:15:00,False
Mamak,"This small, sleek, colorful dining room manages to instantly transport you to the streets of Malaysia, where vendors serve near-identical versions of Mamak’s sambal okra, Hainanese chicken, wok-fried flat rice noodles, mustard green fish head soup, and curry laksa. The real-deal cooking—along with the fact that most entrees are priced below $15, and only one of the lunch specials exceeds $8—makes it a place that demands repeat visits. These dishes are but a few of the many reasons Mamak has a rabid following.",1,Doraville,5150 Buford Highway,mamak-kitchen.com,01:15:00,00:20:00,False
Woo Nam Jeong (Stone Bowl House),"Sizzling dolsots (blazing hot stone bowls) of Atlanta’s best bibimbap come spicy with kimchi or more subdued with a mix of braised mushrooms seasoned with sweet soy sauce (there’s even an oceanic version with squid or eel). From the moment the owner introduces herself as “Grandma,” you know Woo Nam Jeong is a special place. Grandma makes nearly every item at this Buford Highway homestyle Korean restaurant from scratch.",1,Doraville,5953 Buford Highway,None,01:24:00,00:21:00,False
El Rey del Taco,"If you’re feeling indecisive about the dozen taco options—from steak to goat, cow’s cheek to tongue, chorizo to al pastor—go for a bunch of $1.60 mini tacos (though we do prefer the full-priced $2.50 ones on a homemade tortilla). There are tons of other worthy things to eat at El Rey, including sizzled meats a la plancha and more than three dozen seafood dishes. El Rey del Taco means “the king of the taco,” and it lives up to its name.",1,Doraville,5288 Buford Highway,elreydeltacoatl.com,01:20:00,00:20:00,False
Food Terminal,"There’s not a more craveable noodle dish in Atlanta than the Thai Chili Pan Mee, a bowl of silky flat noodles topped with dried anchovies, ground chicken, shiitakes, spinach, and a fried egg. Additional locations have opened on the Westside (1000 Marietta Street Northwest), in Sandy Springs (6440 Aria Boulevard), and in Alpharetta (6360 North Point Parkway). And the well-oiled kitchen cranks out clever takes on Malaysian food, a mix of Chinese, Indian, Singaporean, and Thai flavors.",1,Chamblee,5000 Buford Highway,foodterminal.com,01:12:00,00:20:00,False
Yet Tuh,"You now can more easily choose from “dishes,” “combo,” “side dishes,” “hot pot,” “noodles,” and “pancake”—and you can’t choose wrong. This humble hideaway just off Buford Highway offers homestyle Korean food at its most comforting: kimchi pancakes, steamed chicken and rice, and bubbling kimchi stew with pork. And for non-Korean speakers, the menu became easier to navigate last year when it was overhauled with both photos and categories translated to English.",1,Doraville,3042 Oakcliff Road,None,01:25:00,00:20:00,False
 Taquería La Oaxaqueña,"Oaxaca is considered one of the culinary capitals of Mexico, and the Oaxacan specialty that eaters have raved about for years at this Jonesboro gem is the tlayuda: a large, grilled tortilla covered pizzalike with refritos, string cheese, avocado, lettuce, and your choice of meat (pork sluiced in chili is tops). You’ll also discover some of the finest tacos in town here; handmade corn tortillas are folded around delicacies such as stewed beef cheeks, tripe, and pork al pastor. Huaraches, the sandal-shaped boats of masa dough, are loaded with rich meat.",1,Jonesboro,605 Mount Zion Road,None,01:36:00,00:21:00,False
Rumi’s Kitchen,"Staged against a turquoise-tiled open kitchen, the dining room is a glamorous setting for grazing on kashk badenjoon (fried eggplant, cream of whey, crispy onion, mint) and charred lamb kebabs perfumed with citrus and saffron. Additional locations opened in Midtown at Colony Square (1175 Peachtree Street Northeast) and at Avalon in Alpharetta (7105 Avalon Boulevard). A second location, which opened at Avalon in 2017, has done little to ease the crowds.",3,Sandy Springs,6112 Roswell Road,rumiskitchen.com,01:22:00,00:20:00,False
9292 Korean Barbecue,"At 9292—the flagship of a growing mini-empire, including the almost-as-good D92 in Decatur—each part is a cut above: a rainbow of daily changing side dishes (banchan) like pickled radishes and soy-glazed peanuts; glistening slices of marbled brisket, pork belly, and ribeye; charcoal grills (which we prefer to their electric counterparts); and a sleek, industrial space. (As for the name: Say “92-92” in Korean, and it sounds like the word for “grill.”) It’s a marvel to watch the servers navigate the labyrinth of semiprivate dining cubicles.",2,Duluth,3360 Satellite Boulevard,facebook.com/9292KBBQ,00:02:00,00:28:00,True
Osteria Mattone,"Dividing the casual barroom from the white-tablecloth side is a partially enclosed tasting room, which showcases an award-winning, mostly Italian wine cellar—though our favorite spot is the covered front patio, where you can soak up Canton Street’s convivial energy. Pasta options (including gluten-free ones) range from plump agnolotti di oxo (braised short rib—stuffed ravioli) to hearty tagliolini Bolognese. Co-owners and siblings Ryan and Daniel Pernice are ever-attentive and easy to spot—think the Property Brothers with beards.",2,Roswell,1095 Canton Street,osteriamattone.com,00:02:00,00:30:00,True
Nam Phuong,"The number of menu options can be overwhelming, but you can’t go wrong with bone-in, steamed chicken over a crisp pile of shredded vegetables, eggless crepes bursting with fragrant shrimp and pork, and cubes of marinated, flash-seared beef tenderloin with fried rice and watercress. Both locations of Nam Phuong are worthwhile starting points to explore the joys of Vietnamese cuisine beyond pho and banh mi, though the Jimmy Carter Boulevard outpost has a bit of an edge on the Buford Highway one.",1,Norcross,5495 Jimmy Carter Boulevard,None,00:02:00,00:22:00,True
Tasty China,"But Tasty China currently is in superb—if not quite Changian—form, churning out stellar dishes including confit-like fish filets in chili oil and velvety, mild chicken with three types of mushrooms. Back then, in 2006, the kitchen was helmed by the talented and elusive Peter Chang, who ignited a love of ma la (hot and numbing spice) that paved the way for Masterpiece and Gu’s. Without Chang, who’s drawn a cult following to restaurants across the South, the original Marietta location faltered at times and flourished at others.",2,Marietta,585 Franklin Gateway,tastychina.net,01:40:00,00:21:00,False
Seed Kitchen & Bar,"Back in 2011, Doug Turbush opened a trailblazing restaurant the likes of which East Cobb hadn’t seen—one with a bright-white, modern, Scandinavian aesthetic, a sophisticated cocktail program, and an idiosyncratic menu. Chicken schnitzel is served with miso mustard, pork-belly sliders arrive on Chinese steam buns, and braised local greens are spiked with soy sauce and chilis. Turbush’s food is mainly modern American but with Southern and global influences.",3,East Cobb,"1311 Johnson Ferry Road, Marietta",eatatseed.com,00:02:00,00:29:00,True
O4W Pizza,"But the biggest draw remains the game-changing pizzas: classic round pies, thick-crust Sicilians, thick-yet-airy Detroit-style, and, of course, grandma. In 2015, the city fell hard for New Jersey native Anthony Spina’s O4W Pizza—and his square, pan-cooked grandma pie in particular. Spina relaunched a month later in Duluth, with an expanded menu that includes a chicken parm hero on housemade bread and handmade cavatelli.",2,Duluth,3117 Main Street,o4wpizza.com,00:02:00,00:37:00,True
La Mixteca Tamale House,"The restaurant’s specialties include all kinds of tamales (perfected by the owner’s mother), some sweet ones and others filled with various meats and moles; ravishingly crisp, giant, blue-corn tlayudas (Mexican pizzas) showered with fresh toppings and housemade sauces; and beautifully deconstructed tamale bowls. The mere sight of the steam table of tamales—with flavors ranging from cactus with cheese to Philly cheesesteak—will set your stomach growling. This fast-casual, family-run, Oaxacan joint brings serious foodie cred to its far-flung suburban location.",1,Suwanee,"1185 Old Peachtree Road, Suwanee",facebook.com/lamixtecatamalehouse,00:03:00,00:32:00,True
