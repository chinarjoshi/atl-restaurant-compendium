0,1. Miller Union,"At Miller Union, Georgia native Steven Satterfield gathers every misguided notion about Southern food and tosses them in the compost heap. What’s left: dishes that are understated revelries (that silky farm egg in lush celery cream, oh my) and honest explorations of the modern South (see: Seasonal Vegetable Plate). That they’re served in the most unpretentious high-end restaurant in Atlanta—equally suitable for the laziest of lunches or the most special occasion—makes the fried pork chop with creamed greens and the duck breast with hoecakes and strawberry even more exceptional.",3,Westside,999 Brady Avenue,00:08:00,00:12:00,True,
1,2. Masterpiece,"The first bite: Masterpiece’s dry-fried eggplant (Eggplant with Chilli Powder and Pepper Ash Powder), which sits at the pinnacle of every iteration we’ve encountered of the beloved Sichuan dish. The second bite: Masterpiece’s Dong Po Pork, a braised brick of pork belly lacquered in a mahogany-hued glaze that tastes as if it were a syrup extracted from a mythical tree. The exterior is crackly-crisp and salty, the interior creamy and sweet, the level of ma la (numbing spice) precisely calibrated with a liberal but not obnoxious dose of fragrant, crunchy Sichuan peppercorns.",2,Duluth,3940 Buford Highway,00:15:00,01:14:00,False,masterpiece-chinese.com
2,3. Spring,"You’ll also find our favorite fish dish in town: pan-roasted halibut with squash, wax beans, asparagus, and beurre blanc. It was situated practically on top of the railroad tracks in a remote corner of Marietta Square, a destination not exactly known for culinary risk-taking. Pappardelle with green garlic cream, morels, fava beans, and Parmesan is a joyous celebration of the restaurant’s namesake.",3,Marietta,36 Mill Street,00:26:00,01:43:00,False,springmarietta.com
3,4. Sushi Hayakawa,"Not only is that your entry fee to the restaurant’s 14-course, two-and-a-half-hour honkaku (authentic) omakase (a Japanese feast in which the diner lets the chef steer); it also gets you front-and-center seats at Atsushi “Art” Hayakawa’s sushi counter. The former will get you premium nigiri (the fish is flown in from Japanese markets) that Hayakawa gently brushes with his housemade soy sauce—and, if you’re lucky, his signature dish of monkfish liver and scallops. Hayakawa is the most delightful character in Atlanta’s food scene, a master of his craft who’s as skilled at handling fish and rice as he is at charming his guests.",4,Doraville,5979 Buford Highway,00:20:00,01:24:00,False,sushihayakawa.com
4,5. Bacchanalia,"Even before the brigade of Atlanta’s high-end restaurants (and high-end everything) began its trek toward less-exclusive zip codes, Bacchanalia entered its second chapter, boldly moving in 1999 to a repurposed warehouse in a then sleepy part of town: the Westside. And though Bacchanalia’s elegantly simple food—crafted with impeccably sourced ingredients (many of them from Quatrano’s own farm)—hasn’t changed much in 26 years, it’s no less influential. Chef Anne Quatrano and her husband, Cliff Harrison, haven’t merely stayed ahead of the curve—they’ve drawn the curve.",4,Westside,1460 Ellsworth Industrial Boulevard,00:12:00,00:20:00,False,starprovisions.com/bacchanalia
5,6. Boccalupo,"Instead of confining himself to narrow traditions, he creates cult favorites: black spaghetti with red shrimp, hot Calabrian sausage, and scallions; 20-yolk tagliatelle with mushrooms and kale kimchi; and pan-fried white lasagna with creme fraiche and jalapeño pesto. BoccaLupo’s appetizers are creative and smart (think octopus and mortadella spiedino or wild calamari in brodetto), its scene intimate yet lively (tucked away in a calm corner of an otherwise oversaturated Inman Park), and its beverage program as accomplished as everything Logue sets his mind to. Head for the covered patio or the minuscule bar, both among the best spots in the city for conversation.",2,Inman Park,753 Edgewood Avenue,00:11:00,00:23:00,False,boccalupoatl.com
6,7. Kimball House,"The vegetable sides—such as a $10 stir fry of mushroom, turnip, broccoli, radish, and greens, glammed up with ají amarillo butter—get as much respect from the kitchen as the $110 steak dinner. Yes, the oyster program is the best around, down to co-owner and bivalve evangelist Bryan Rackley’s impressively specific tasting notes (“green beans & cantaloupe . . . From grouper collar to bar steak, lemon-pepper chicken skins to caviar and Carolina Gold rice middlins, there’s nothing Kimball House can’t do.",3,Decatur,303 East Howard Avenue,00:22:00,00:46:00,False,kimball-house.com
7,8. LanZhou Ramen,"The resulting noodles—or, if you prefer, the thicker, knife-cut ones—show up in bowls of fragrant beef broth brimming with wilted greens and tender meat, or stir-fried with your choice of three spice options: regular, spicy, or laced with cumin seeds. The city of Lanzhou is the noodle capital of China, and Buford Highway strip-mall joint LanZhou Ramen is the noodle capital of metro Atlanta. You can (and should) observe their creation by gazing into LanZhou’s kitchen through a picture window that dramatically frames the hypnotic act of rolling, stretching, and spinning the cascading tendrils of springy dough.",1,Doraville,5231 Buford Highway,00:21:00,01:16:00,False,lanzhouramenatlanta.com
8,9. Staplehouse,"Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, Staplehouse has gracefully met the moment, closing its dining room and reconfiguring into a market offering charcuterie, pastries, and house-made pantry items to go, plus a judicious selection of prepared dishes (beef cheek hand pie, alkaline noodles with turnips and chili crisp, chicken liver tart) that can either be taken away or consumed on-site, drink in hand, on a beautiful outdoor patio space.",2,Old Fourth Ward,541 Edgewood Avenue,00:09:00,00:21:00,False,staplehouse.com
9,10. Talat Market,"In practice, that means dishes like yum phonlamai, a salad built around whatever fruit is in season (peach, melon, blueberries) dressed with a savory, funky mix of lemongrass, mint, cilantro, scallop floss, and fish sauce; yum khao tod, a crispy rice salad with housemade red chili jam; the meat salad laab, featuring ingredients as disparate as duck heart and sunchokes; crispy mussel pancakes; and much, much more. Decorated with a lavish mural, lush green walls, and ceiling-hung flower pots, Talat Market stays on its toes and keeps diners on theirs with a daily-changing menu based on a winning concept: Thai technique, Georgia ingredients. When Parnass Savang and Rod Lassiter finally opened this brick-and-mortar space in the inauspicious month of April 2020, they were doing curbside service only, finding themselves selling out every night.",2,Summerhill,112 Ormond Street,00:12:00,00:28:00,False,talatmarketatl.com
10,Wonderkid,"Like the restaurant’s designers, opening chef Justin Dixon—who has recently moved on to other pastures—was refreshingly unfaithful to the diner concept: His often brilliant interpretations cover not just the classics (English breakfast, meatloaf melt with pimento cheese and bacon jam) but also wonderful mushroom empanadas and chicken wings prepared “Buford Highway style,” with chili oil, peanuts, and lime. It might look something like this spot in the Atlanta Dairies complex, which eschews retro kitsch in favor of a riotous aesthetic mashup: This is a diner with groovy wallpaper, ’70s lighting, and pictures of Prince on the wall, plus a bartender behind a curved counter slinging potent cocktails. It sprang from a partnership between Big Citizen (the group behind Bon Ton and the Lawrence) and King of Pops, whose soft-serve is available here on its own or blended into boozy drinks.",2,Reynoldstown,777 Memorial Drive,00:22:00,01:05:00,False,wonderkidatl.com
11,Little Bear,"The engagingly written menu changes with the seasons, with temporary treasures (one night recently: Georgia shrimp with fig sweet-and-sour sauce and shishito peppers; eggplant with peaches, whey sauce, chili paste, and “herbs out the ass”) joining a few repeat faves, like chicken thighs with dan dan yogurt and Manischewitz vinegar and a striking black and white torte. But Stieber, pivoting to a takeout-only model, endured through the pandemic, finally welcoming diners this past May to sit down in Little Bear’s bright, modern dining room and enjoy his weird, iconoclastic, Jewish-ish/Sichuan-ish cooking. After making his name with the pop-up series Eat Me Speak Me, Stieber finally made the move to brick-and-mortar with Little Bear, which opened in Summerhill in February 2020.",2,Summerhill,71 Georgia Avenue,00:10:00,00:27:00,False,littlebearatl.com
12,Nur Kitchen,"He’s a magician with classics like hummus and baba ghanoush, and his eclectic background—Lavi was born in Israel, of Turkish and Libyan descent—informs the wide Eastern Mediterranean scope of this restaurant, whose pantry of inspirations stretches “from Turkey to Jaffa Port.” Driving out on Buford Highway toward Norcross, you’ll hear the siren songs of about a thousand incredible restaurants before you even make it to Nur Kitchen’s parking lot—but if it’s some of the metro’s best mezze you’re after, it’s best to put your hands over your ears, keep your eyes on the road, and arrive here hungry. A spectacular talent whose range continues to reveal itself, Lavi gained fans through his catering business Let’s Eat and in the kitchen of the delicious but short-lived downtown restaurant Rozina Bakehouse.",2,Buford Highway,7130 Buford Highway,00:21:00,01:27:00,False,nurkitchenusa.com
13,Tum Pok Pok,"Weerasin’s larb—pork or chicken, seasoned with lime juice and tiny chilis, ginger, peanuts, and scallions, and served with sticky rice and cabbage leaves—offers a world of bracing flavor. Buford Highway has long lacked much of a Thai scene—so when Tum Pok Pok opened up in the same blessed BuHi shopping plaza as Food Terminal and Saigon Tofu, it was a welcome addition to our city’s most international corridor. Weerasin herself is from the south of Thailand and has been rolling out nightly specials that reflect that region, like a crab omelet and kua kling: a perilously hot but tasty dish of ground pork with red curry paste and shaved makrut lime leaves.",1,Chamblee,5000 Buford Highway,00:20:00,01:12:00,False,tumpokpok.com
14,Lucian Books and Wine,"Or maybe it just felt like a sigh of relief: What sweeter pleasure than to share a plate and a bottle with an old friend—or a new fancy—in this chic but inviting dining room on a busy Buckhead corner? Dishes change seasonally, but expect fare like buttery raw hamachi and thinly sliced black radish, doused tableside with a vinegar-spiked buttermilk dressing, and ricotta gnudi with truffle and maitake mushroom and a luscious beurre monté. The cellar may be spacious, but the larder ain’t: Chef Brian Hendrickson’s tightly focused, finely executed menu features a handful of small plates, a few entrees, and a bowl of french fries worth ordering for the lemony sorrel mayo alone.",3,Buckhead,3005 Peachtree Road,00:16:00,00:32:00,False,lucianbooksandwine.com
15,Supremo Taco,"It eventually landed a spot on Memorial Drive, though the counter-service, takeout-only model means it retains some streetside vibes—and helped it weather the pandemic, when Supremo was more impervious than most to lockdowns and mandates, and when its legions of fans found great comfort enfolded in its astonishing handmade tortillas. Supremo sold out often during the pandemic and still does: particularly, crowd-pleasers like lamb barbacoa with chili de arbol, chicken mole poblano, black bean with squash and tomato, aguachile tostadas, fried quesadillas . . . Supremo built its rep as a taco truck doing late-night test runs at 8Arm, which is co-owned by Supremo partner Nhan Le.",1,Grant Park,701 Memorial Drive,00:11:00,00:25:00,False,supremotaco.com
16,Buena Gente Cuban Bakery,"They overlook no detail in the construction of the iconic Cuban sandwich: The bolo ham is delicious, the mustard is sharp, the mojo-roasted pork carries an enchanting hint of the citrus it was marinated in, and the melty Swiss cheese and pressed, crunchy bread elevate this creation to near-pizza levels of perfection. Cubanos and other sandwiches (medianoche, pan con bistec) aren’t the only items Buena Gente has aced: The glass dessert case is packed with perfectly rendered pastries from chicken empanadas to guava-filled pastelitos, arroz con leche to tres leches cake. The good people behind this cute-as-a-button operation, Manny Rodriguez and Stacie Antich, first opened their food truck in 2016, making the leap in 2020 to a narrow storefront in a busy Decatur strip mall.",1,Decatur,1365 Clairmont Road,00:21:00,00:45:00,False,buenagenteatl.com
17,Chef Winnie’s Kitchen,"When it comes to the tried and true, her renditions are exquisite: Emory’s combo kitfo (ground beef seasoned with the brightly colored chili blend mitmita and sauteed in purified butter) and fitfit (torn injera soaked in spicy sauce) is one of the best dishes we ate all year, and her many vegan or vegetarian entrees easily compete in the big leagues. And that’s just the half of it: Chef Winnie is equally adept with curries, fish tacos, Philly cheesesteaks, and bespoke creations like an Ethiopian-spiced quesadilla stuffed with chicken and veggies. Humble even by Clarkston standards, this minuscule spot from Woinshet Legesse Emory—aka Chef Winnie—is an international wonder with an Ethiopian heart.",1,Clarkston,4238 East Ponce de Leon Avenue,00:25:00,01:15:00,False,chefwinnieskitchen.com
18,Lake and Oak Neighborhood BBQ,"Fans flock here (SORRY) for the chicken, brined for a day to enhance its tenderness and slathered in a collard pesto; for the coffee- and pepper-rubbed brisket; for the rib slabs and the cider-vinegar pulled pork; and for creative sides like collard green fried rice. Opening in July 2020, Richards and partner Joshua Lee took the pandemic in stride, inviting diners to hit up the takeout window and keep their social distance on a convivial streetside patio. That happy al fresco scene (and the smells wafting from the Big Green Egg smoker out front) beckons passersby into an instant top-tier player in a city that doesn’t lack for barbecue joints.",1,East Lake,2358 Hosea L.

19,Floataway Cafe,"Star chef-restaurateur Anne Quatrano’s airy little Mediterranean oasis, which for more than two decades has resided in an industrial complex near Emory, is so chic it could’ve opened yesterday.

20,Canoe,"And a special of roasted monkfish with broccoli rabe and fingerlings in a caper vinaigrette is the type of thing we’d like to eat every day—for the next 30 years. If you haven’t been to the nearly 30-year-old restaurant in a while, you won’t have forgotten that view—but you might not recall how equally ravishing the food is.

21,Sotto Sotto,"Classic pasta options—such as tortelli di Michelangelo Buonarroti, a 16th century recipe of veal, chicken, and pork ravioli in a butter-sage sauce—are the kind of thing you want to eat forever. In this age of ever-adapting seasonal menus, Sotto Sotto’s mostly unchanged lineup still holds our rapt attention. There’s a reason Riccardo Ullio’s Inman Park stalwart has been around for more than two decades: It’s our most consistent and satisfying Italian spot.",2,Inman Park,313 North Highland Avenue,00:11:00,00:20:00,False,sottosottoatl.com
22,Kyma,"You can make a feast out of chef Pano Karatassos’s nearly two-dozen shareable meze plates—in particular, wood-grilled octopus with olives and capers, white beans stewed with tomatoes, and lamb pie. The ocean-blue and gleaming-white temple known as Kyma, which means “wave” in Greek, is Buckhead Life Restaurant Group’s brightest star. If you want to splurge, choose one of the $40-per-pound whole fish that are so beautifully arranged in the restaurant’s display case they appear to be swimming through a sea of crushed ice.",3,Buckhead,3085 Piedmont Road,00:15:00,00:38:00,False,buckheadrestaurants.com/restaurant/kyma
23,La Grotta Ristorante Italiano,"La Grotta opened in 1978, and it’s a welcome throwback to another time—when white tablecloths still graced tables and truffles were shaved onto your plate tableside. In the basement of an unassuming south Buckhead apartment building sits one of Atlanta’s oldest restaurants. The regal servers deliver bygone glamour, along with a wide range of pasta and veal options.",3,Buckhead,2637 Peachtree Road,00:15:00,00:28:00,False,lagrottaatlanta.com

The kitchen staff responsible for Tiny Lou’s 1.0 have since moved on, replaced in spring 2021 by executive chef Jon Novak (formerly sous chef of the Napa Valley restaurant Torc) and pastry chef Charmain Ware. Novak’s menu offers bistro favorites—steak frites, French onion soup, swordfish au poivre—and specialties that change with the seasons; Ware’s pastries, like those of predecessor Claudia Martinez, are works of art.",3,Poncey-Highland,789 Ponce de Leon Avenue,00:09:00,00:15:00,True,tinylous.com
25,Octopus Bar,"The 2011 brainchild of Nhan Le and the late Angus Brown, Octopus Bar is still the coolest restaurant in Atlanta, and chef Alexander Young’s dishes are as punk as they are pretty: dry-fried eggplant, served skin-on, is seasoned with black garlic oil, and icicle radishes delicately intermingle with tendrils of radish pods atop a sheet of creamy chevre. Even before Octopus Bar opens at 10:30 p.m., the night owls will have swooped in to claim their perch.

26,Ticonderoga Club,"In this endearingly dark little room in the corner of Krog Street Market, Greg Best and Paul Calvert—two of the city’s most ingenious bartenders—mix and stir and shake and dazzle; their concise cocktail list is reason enough to endure the weekend wait. But even those drinks can’t upstage executive chef David Bies’s nostalgia-inducing menu—including the city’s best clam roll, best steak tartare, and best Cobb salad.",3,Inman Park,99 Krog Street,00:10:00,00:21:00,False,ticonderogaclub.com
27,Bon Ton,"Bon Ton is no doubt as cool as its predecessor, and the Viet-Cajun menu is clever without being too much so: You’ll find ground beef wrapped in betel leaves, seafood boils, oyster and cilantro dirty fried rice, and one of our favorite sandwiches: a Nashville hot oyster roll that’s extra punched up with XO sauce. Co-owner Eric Simpkins, a longtime denizen of Ponce, teamed up with Hieu Pham of Buford Highway’s Crawfish Shack and Darren Carr of the former Top Flr to create the perfect concept to fill Top Flr’s void. This relative newcomer to the Ponce corridor feels like its been part of the street’s eccentric culture forever, and that’s a high compliment.",2,Midtown,674 Myrtle Street,00:05:00,00:10:00,True,bontonatl.com
28,8Arm,"The menu can be a challenge to navigate, but 8Arm’s raw-fish offerings and nightly specials range from pristine (various cuts of bluefish tuna reveal the depths of flavor the fish has to offer) to sublime (raw sea bream with watermelon radish kimchi). The kitchen offers pitch-perfect renditions of Japanese street foods—dumplings, edamame, the battered octopus balls takoyaki—as well as rotating dishes like buttery, nut-brown miso cod and the savory custard chawanmushi. This hip Ponce restaurant has lived many lives, forced to reinvent itself in 2017 after the sudden death of original chef-partner Angus Brown, and then again in 2021 with the departure of the redoubtable Maricela Vega.",2,Virginia-Highland,710 Ponce de Leon Avenue,00:08:00,00:13:00,True,8armatl.com
29,Poor Hendrix,"Russell composes marvelous salads (think local lettuces, Manchego, peanuts, and pickled green beans) and elevates peanut butter mousse with olive oil, salt, and peanut meringue—but he isn’t above serving wings and Rice Krispies treats. Once you’re inside, you’ll find a long, narrow bar that feels like a clubhouse for young, stylish neighbors hip to chef Aaron Russell, whose career includes influential stints at fine-dining bastions Seeger’s (RIP) and Restaurant Eugene.

30,Gunshow,"The dining room is short on luxury—stark spotlights, metal tables, loud rock music—but high on intrigue. You might find Hawaiian paté en croute with pineapple, jalapeño, and Parmesan aioli, or confit sunchoke with peanuts, garlic, coffee, and seaweed.

32,Argosy,"It pulls off this juggling act in a large, easygoing nerd paradise where custom-built wooden sea creatures hang from the ceiling and analog parlor games are played in the back. The menu at this East Atlanta Village gastropub offers everything from Shaolin Wings (with Tokyo mayo and purple daikon) to charred octopus (with fingerlings, fennel, and fried capers).

34,The Optimist,"At Ford Fry’s stylishly nautical seafood restaurant, there are many ways to plot a course to an ideal meal, but here’s our favorite: a dozen impeccable oysters; one of four crudos (think salmon with chorizo, strawberry, and fava bean); a hulking tentacle of octopus; and the best lobster roll in the city.

Lest you scoff at its $25 price tag, take note that this wrap could easily feed you for three days—and that it’s so magical you’ll actually want to spend three days eating it.

There is no better restaurant co-owned by a rapper and named for a seminal album—especially if, like the intro track from Ludacris’s Chicken-n-Beer, you prefer your comfort food “Southern Fried.” If or when Luda and company decide to expand the franchise beyond Hartsfield-Jackson, and members of the general public have an easier time getting hold of the short-rib mac and cheese, it will be even clearer that this food holds its own against restaurants far beyond Concourse D.",2,Hartsfield-Jackson,"Concourse D, Gate 5",00:15:00,01:14:00,False,chickenandbeer.com

Nevertheless, what you eat is likely sourced from a local or regional farm, which gives Pascarella the opportunity to draft new and imaginative culinary tales—or should we say A Moveable Feast?

45,El Tesoro,"“El Tesoro” means “the treasure,” and the restaurant’s owners have found one in Cristina Lugo Soto, a home cook who hails from the Mexican coastal state of Guerrero and runs the kitchen with her daughter, Mayra. The tacos come as tacos are supposed to, with supremely flavorful meat that requires no embellishment aside from micro-diced onion, a light shower of chopped cilantro, a squeeze of lime, and, if you must, a streak of one of three homemade salsas. Soto offers three tamale flavors—pork with green salsa, chicken with chipotle salsa, and rajas with mushroom and squash—and if there’s a more craveable masa in existence, we’ve yet to find it.",1,Edgewood,1374 Arkwright Place,00:11:00,00:31:00,False,eltesoroatl.com
46,Snackboxe Bistro,"Inspired by the bright flavors they encountered on a trip to their native Laos, husband and wife Vanh Sengaphone and Thip Athakhanh craft street food–inspired dishes vibrant with heat and acid, including a peerless laap (a spicy and tart meat salad more commonly known by its Thai name, larb) and a sinus-clearing bowl of khao poon (its curry broth, rich with coconut milk, clings to long rice noodles). But with the early 2018 opening of insta-hit Snackboxe in Doraville, there’s now an excellent representation of the underappreciated cuisine right in our backyard. Laotian food has long been overshadowed in Atlanta by the cuisine of neighboring Thailand.",1,Doraville,6035 Peachtree Road,00:21:00,01:16:00,False,snackboxebistro.com
47,Heirloom Market BBQ,"Heirloom is a love story—between its co-owners, wife and husband Jiyeon Lee and Cody Taylor, and between the homestyle Korean cooking of her childhood and the homestyle Texan cooking of his. As with all great love stories, the passion between miso paste and collard greens or kimchi and coleslaw was almost accidental at first, but these pairings were clearly meant to be. Our only gripe is that the mostly takeout operation offers just a few standing tables; this food is too good to rush through while on your feet and too tempting to drive all the way home with.",1,Cumberland,2243 Akers Mill Road,00:16:00,01:19:00,False,heirloommarketbbq.com
48,Chai Pani,"Gone are the beloved okra fries—but in their place are fantastically flavored dishes like tomato cheese uttapam (a fermented rice and lentil pancake, served with two kinds of chutney), Indo-Chinese–style chili chicken, and a Bengali-style fried catfish filet. Meherwan Irani’s Decatur destination—part of a mini empire stretching between Atlanta and Asheville—has pivoted several times in recent years, switching to takeout-only during the pandemic and then reopening, in summer 2021, with a refreshed menu that emphasizes Indian home-cooking favorites and regional specialties.

49,Community Q BBQ,"Opened in 2009 with several partners in a tight little shopping center near Emory, Community Q offers moist and tender pulled pork that isn’t obnoxiously smoky, reliably robust St. Louis ribs, and ridiculously rich and creamy three-cheese mac and cheese. You may want to mix the vinegar-based sauce into the tomato and molasses one—but, as is true of the best barbecue joints, these meats are tasty enough to eschew the sauces entirely. Back then, hoity-toity chefs hadn’t begun to launch the kind of barbecue operations that source their meats extra carefully and support organic farms.",1,North Decatur,1361 Clairmont Road,00:21:00,00:45:00,False,communityqbbq.com
50,Taqueria del Sol,"Two decades and six locations later, customers still line up for Hernandez’s Southern-Mexican mashup cuisine: fried-chicken tacos with lime-jalapeño mayonnaise, refried-bean enchiladas with a side of turnip greens, and shrimp corn chowder. Eddie Hernandez and Mike Klank opened the first Taqueria del Sol on the Westside in 2000, cranking out crowd-pleasing $2 tacos.

When Hudson Rouse, formerly of Home Grown, and his wife, Kathryn Fitzgerald Rouse, opened this creative meat-and-three for breakfast and lunch in 2016, the crowds flocked.

52,Fox Bros. Bar-B-Q,"The brothers’ brisket is legendary, but just as epic are their over-the-top barbecue offerings: the camp classic Frito Pie served in the actual bag, hickory-smoked jumbo wings dressed in homemade sauce, and a nine-inch, smoked beef rib that looks like something a caveman might devour. The Foxes have built upon their success with a line of barbecue and wing sauce sold at Whole Foods and other stores, a partnership with the Atlanta Falcons, and a “Que-osk” location near SweetWater Brewing.

Growing up, Lis Hernandez spent countless days with her mother in the kitchen making arepas—stuffed cornmeal patties, crunchy from a hot grill—that they sold on the streets in their native Venezuela. Hernandez’s arepas first appeared in Atlanta at the Sweet Auburn Curb Market in 2012, and she still sells them there.",1,Avondale Estates,10 North Clarendon Avenue,00:27:00,00:55:00,False,arepamiaatlanta.com
54,Taqueria Don Sige,"But ignore any misinformed impulses because you’re here for traditional tacos (chopped onion, cilantro, lime, and radish), irresistibly priced at $1.50 each (pollo is great, but chorizo, camarones, and lengua are phenomenal). Located behind a gas station, in a tiny strip mall on the border of College Park and East Point, Don Sige isn’t known for its decor. The spicy salsa verde isn’t complex and doesn’t need to be, and the expertly wrapped burrito and liberally sauced steak fajita are as flavorful as they are unfancy.",1,College Park,1720 Vesta Avenue,00:18:00,00:51:00,False,None
55,Desta Ethiopian Kitchen,"Despite the competition, it’s still the best place in town to scoop up kitfo (raw, minced beef seasoned with chili powder and spiced butter) and miser (red lentils stewed with cayenne, onion, garlic, and ginger) using soft, spongy, fermented injera bread. The menu, which allows you to make decisions based on how daring you are, demystifies Ethiopian cuisine, and the tree that rises up from the middle of the covered patio and through its roof makes you forget you’re in the middle of an asphalt sea.

56,Aria,"Plates are adorned with drops and loops and smears of sauces, and even if that’s not typically your thing, you’ll still be wowed by Aria’s artistry—particularly when the plate holds caramelized scallops with perfect piles of sunchoke, Brussels, and rutabaga. Perhaps you’ve had your fill of beet salads, but you haven’t had a beet salad until you’ve had this one; with gold and ruby-red wedges mingling with candied walnuts atop thick, lemony yogurt, the dish is exceptional in its simplicity. Whether the date night in question is prom, an anniversary, an engagement, or some less monumental event, Aria is up to the occasion.",4,Buckhead,490 East Paces Ferry Road,00:14:00,00:37:00,False,aria-atl.com
57,Tomo,"Your best option is to snag one of five nightly spots for Naito’s omakase (tasting menu), which starts at $100 and could include fluke with ponzu gelee and a lamb chop dusted in citrusy, almost minty sansho powder. If you want to fully experience Tomo, skip the sprawling menu; the shrimp tempura roll and teriyaki-glazed chicken breast will only distract you from the immensity of chef Tomohiro Naito’s gift for Japanese cuisine. Your faux-makase could include slivers of superfresh sashimi shimmering in a shallow pool of yuzu ponzu and extra-virgin olive oil and a simple slice of miso-marinated, broiled black cod.",4,Buckhead,3630 Peachtree Road,00:14:00,00:44:00,False,tomorestaurant.com
58,Bones,"Even lunch at the bar is a treat, a prime perch for sipping a martini, chowing down on one of the city’s best burgers, and indulging in a mile-high ice cream pie. Start with lump-crab cocktail or lobster bisque or a wedge salad, and pair your steak or chop with a loaded baked potato and grilled asparagus.

59,Lazy Betty,"Hsu’s Steak & Eggs is a nod to his family’s frequent visits to Waffle House, but in his version, a dry-aged New York strip is accompanied by a sous-vide egg wrapped in a wasabi leaf. In the magnificently transformed Candler Park space that formerly housed Radial Cafe, choose from two tasting menus—six courses for $130 or eight for $170 (gratuity included). And though he’s opened the most ambitious new restaurant Atlanta has seen in several years, that doesn’t mean his rarefied food is short on fun.",4,Candler Park,1530 DeKalb Avenue,00:15:00,00:30:00,False,lazybettyatl.com
60,Mamak,"This small, sleek, colorful dining room manages to instantly transport you to the streets of Malaysia, where vendors serve near-identical versions of Mamak’s sambal okra, Hainanese chicken, wok-fried flat rice noodles, mustard green fish head soup, and curry laksa. The real-deal cooking—along with the fact that most entrees are priced below $15, and only one of the lunch specials exceeds $8—makes it a place that demands repeat visits.

61,Woo Nam Jeong (Stone Bowl House),"Sizzling dolsots (blazing hot stone bowls) of Atlanta’s best bibimbap come spicy with kimchi or more subdued with a mix of braised mushrooms seasoned with sweet soy sauce (there’s even an oceanic version with squid or eel). From the moment the owner introduces herself as “Grandma,” you know Woo Nam Jeong is a special place.

There are tons of other worthy things to eat at El Rey, including sizzled meats a la plancha and more than three dozen seafood dishes.

Additional locations have opened on the Westside (1000 Marietta Street Northwest), in Sandy Springs (6440 Aria Boulevard), and in Alpharetta (6360 North Point Parkway).

This humble hideaway just off Buford Highway offers homestyle Korean food at its most comforting: kimchi pancakes, steamed chicken and rice, and bubbling kimchi stew with pork. And for non-Korean speakers, the menu became easier to navigate last year when it was overhauled with both photos and categories translated to English.",1,Doraville,3042 Oakcliff Road,00:20:00,01:26:00,False,None
65, Taquería La Oaxaqueña,"Oaxaca is considered one of the culinary capitals of Mexico, and the Oaxacan specialty that eaters have raved about for years at this Jonesboro gem is the tlayuda: a large, grilled tortilla covered pizzalike with refritos, string cheese, avocado, lettuce, and your choice of meat (pork sluiced in chili is tops). You’ll also discover some of the finest tacos in town here; handmade corn tortillas are folded around delicacies such as stewed beef cheeks, tripe, and pork al pastor.

68,Osteria Mattone,"Dividing the casual barroom from the white-tablecloth side is a partially enclosed tasting room, which showcases an award-winning, mostly Italian wine cellar—though our favorite spot is the covered front patio, where you can soak up Canton Street’s convivial energy. Pasta options (including gluten-free ones) range from plump agnolotti di oxo (braised short rib—stuffed ravioli) to hearty tagliolini Bolognese.

Both locations of Nam Phuong are worthwhile starting points to explore the joys of Vietnamese cuisine beyond pho and banh mi, though the Jimmy Carter Boulevard outpost has a bit of an edge on the Buford Highway one.",1,Norcross,5495 Jimmy Carter Boulevard,00:22:00,00:02:00,True,None

Back then, in 2006, the kitchen was helmed by the talented and elusive Peter Chang, who ignited a love of ma la (hot and numbing spice) that paved the way for Masterpiece and Gu’s.

In 2015, the city fell hard for New Jersey native Anthony Spina’s O4W Pizza—and his square, pan-cooked grandma pie in particular.
